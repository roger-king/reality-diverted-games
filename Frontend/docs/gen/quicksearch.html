    {"index.html":{"id":"index.html","title":"Index","body":" Documentation Modern-Angular-SeedIn the ongoing effort to chase the elusive unicorn of a resuable project seed that is atleast sorta current, ive decided to maintain this repo! Commands npm run test runs test suite npm run gulp lint runs eslint on the project npm run dev starts local browser synch server and compiles app npm run prod runs the production tasks and bundles the application, it will also replace your localhost api with whatever you have set as production npm run gulp component scaffolds a new Angular component. Read below for usage details. Goals sensible and easy to follow pattern for app construction tests and documentation inluded and entwined into the app allowing easy to follow patterns Features Angular 1.5 Angular Material Sass JsDoc Generating ComponentsFollowing a consistent directory structure between components offers us the certainty of predictability. We can take advantage of this certainty by creating a gulp task to automate the &quot;instantiation&quot; of our components. The component boilerplate task generates this: ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName/ ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.js // entry file where all its dependencies load ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.component.js ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.controller.js ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.html ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.styl // scoped to affect only its own template ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.spec.js // contains passing demonstration testsYou may, of course, create these files manually, every time a new module is needed, but that gets quickly tedious. To generate a component, run gulp component --name componentName. The parameter following the --name flag is the name of the component to be created. Ensure that it is unique or it will overwrite the preexisting identically-named component. The component will be created, by default, inside client/app/components. To change this, apply the --parent flag, followed by a path relative to client/app/components/. For example, running gulp component --name signup --parent auth will create a signup component at client/app/components/auth/signup. Running gulp component --name footer --parent ../common creates a footer component at client/app/common/footer. Because the argument to --name applies to the folder name and the actual component name, make sure to camelcase the component names.
